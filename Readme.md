## ðŸ¥¶ About the Project

I developed this project as part of a mobile developer challenge to improve my skills in React Native, navigation, and state management. The main goal was to create a functional and user-friendly app for listing car brands and their respective models, following best practices and industry standards.

## Mobile React Native:

**Application:** The app allows users to log in, view a list of car brands, and navigate to see detailed models for each brand. It features a responsive design, dynamic data fetching, and a smooth user experience by leveraging modern tools like Context API, React Navigation, and styled components.
